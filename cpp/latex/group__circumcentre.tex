Finds the cirumcentre of the triangle formed by three given points. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em ax,ay} & x and y coordinates of first vertex \\
\hline
{\em bx,by} & x and y coordinates of second vertex \\

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
Circumcentre of points a, b and c
\end{DoxyReturn}
The cirumcentre of a triangle is the unique point in $R^2$ that is equidistant from its three vertices. This is the equivalent of X(a, b, c) as defined in Section 2 of reference \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}.
