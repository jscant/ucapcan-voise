The S\+K\+IZ operator algorithm, described by Sequeira and Preteux in \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}, is an efficient way of calculating and maintaining a Voronoi diagram in discrete 2D space. Unlike other, more popular algorithms such as Fortune\textquotesingle{}s Sweep, the S\+K\+IZ algorithm is dynamic so adding and removing seeds does not require recalculation of the entire graph. Moreover, checking the bounds of a region R(s) and checking whether a pixel p belongs to a region R(s) is reduced to evaluation of a small number of inequalities -\/ a number which is bounded above by twice the number of neighbouring seeds.

The discrete nature of the S\+K\+IZ algorithm makes it well suited to image segmentation. The V\+O\+I\+SE algorithm \mbox{[}2\mbox{]} relies on a fast and dynamic method of recalculation of Voronoi diagrams upon addition and removal of seeds, so the two are a natural fit. Although a standalone version of the S\+K\+IZ algorithm is included here (mostly for testing), the main functionality is provided by the matlab bindings in push\+VD, grab\+VD, add\+Seed\+To\+VD and remove\+Seed\+From\+VD, which are compiled into Matlab-\/readable M\+EX binaries and are tailored specifically for the code built and maintained by P. Guio and N. Achilleos to aid faster image analysis through V\+O\+I\+SE.\hypertarget{index_req_sec}{}\section{System Requirements}\label{index_req_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A Linux 64-\/bit distribution. Software developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.\+04.
\item Matlab 2018a or newer. Compilation of M\+EX binaries uses some new routines that are not present in earlier versions, but precompiled binaries can still be used.
\item Eigen3 installed
\item Doxygen installed
\item C\+Make version 3.\+10.\+1 or newer
\item gcc 6.\+3.

\hypertarget{index_step1}{}\subsection{Step 1\+: Compile the C++ functions, tests and stand-\/alone executables}\label{index_step1}
Open a terminal. Navigate to {\ttfamily voise-\/1.\+3/matlab/cpp/build}. Excecute the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    cmake ..
    make
\end{DoxyVerb}


Compilation should take a few minutes.\hypertarget{index_step2}{}\subsection{Step 2\+: Compile the M\+E\+X binaries}\label{index_step2}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open Matlab (version 2018a or newer required for compilation; older versions can run precompiled binaries)
\item In Matlab, Navigate to {\ttfamily voise-\/1.\+3/matlab}.
\item Run {\ttfamily compile\+M\+EX}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Compilation should take a few minutes.\hypertarget{index_references_sec}{}\section{References}\label{index_references_sec}
