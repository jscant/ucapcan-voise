\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em output\+VD} & Voronoi diagram from which data is read \\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em plhs} & Pointer to mx\+Array object which is the start of the section of memory to be populated with data and which Matlab will interpret as a struct containing all of the information from output\+VD. This is part of the Matlab bindings for the V\+O\+I\+SE algorithm \mbox{[}2\mbox{]}, and is only compatible with the code written to this end by P. Guio and N. Achilleos. \\
