\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em prhs} & Voronoi diagram in the form of a Matlab struct with the relevant fields filled in the correct manner. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
Voronoi diagram (vd) object containing all relevant information.
\end{DoxyReturn}
The larger matrices ( $ \lambda, \nu $ in \mbox{[}1\mbox{]} as well as px and py) are not copied but mapped using Eigen\textquotesingle{}s map class for reasons of speed.

This is part of the Matlab bindings for the V\+O\+I\+SE algorithm \mbox{[}2\mbox{]}, and is only compatible with the code written to this end by P. Guio and N. Achilleos.
