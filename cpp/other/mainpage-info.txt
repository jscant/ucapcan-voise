/** @mainpage SKIZ Voronoi Diagram Tool and Matlab Bindings for VOISE Algorithm
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The SKIZ operator algorithm, described by Sequeira and Preteux in [1], is an efficient way of calculating
 * and maintaining a Voronoi diagram in discrete 2D space. Unlike other, more popular algorithms such as Fortune's
 * Sweep, the SKIZ algorithm is dynamic so adding and removing seeds does not require recalculation of the entire graph.
 * Moreover, checking the bounds of a region R(s) and checking whether a pixel p belongs to a region R(s) is reduced
 * to evaluation of a small number of inequalities - a number which is bounded above by twice the number of neighbouring
 * seeds.
 *
 * The discrete nature of the SKIZ algorithm makes it well suited to image segmentation. The VOISE algorithm [2] relies
 * on a fast and dynamic method of recalculation of Voronoi diagrams upon addition and removal of seeds, so the two are
 * a natural fit. Although a standalone version of the SKIZ algorithm is included here (mostly for testing), the main
 * functionality is provided by the matlab bindings in pushVD, grabVD, addSeedToVD and removeSeedFromVD, which are
 * compiled into Matlab-readable MEX binaries and are tailored specifically for the code built and maintained by
 * P. Guio and N. Achilleos to aid faster image analysis through VOISE.
 *
 * @section req_sec System Requirements
 *
 * - A Linux 64-bit distribution. Software developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
 * - Matlab 2018a or newer. Compilation of MEX binaries uses some new routines that are not present in earlier versions,
 * but precompiled binaries can still be used.
 * - Eigen3 installed
 * - Doxygen installed
 * - CMake version 3.10.1 or newer
 * - gcc 6.3.
 *
 * @section install_sec Compilation
 *
 * @subsection step1 Step 1: Compile the C++ functions, tests and stand-alone executables
 *
 * Open a terminal. Navigate to <code>voise-1.3/matlab/cpp/build</code>. Excecute the following commands:

           cmake ..
           make

 * Compilation should take a few minutes.
 *
 * @subsection step2 Step 2: Compile the MEX binaries
 *
 * -# Open Matlab (version 2018a or newer required for compilation; older versions can run precompiled binaries)
 * -# In Matlab, Navigate to <code>voise-1.3/matlab</code>.
 * -# Run <code>compileMEX</code>


 * Compilation should take a few minutes.
